Some things work

## Chat Server
- can't get the user input to not appear in terminal...


## File Transfer
- transfer files over internal network


## File Serve
- Run with sudo for port 80
- don't use localhost, but rather 0.0.0.0 for accessing from internal network.

## Websockets
- A chat example taken from here:
http://41j.com/blog/2014/12/gorilla-websockets-golang-simple-websockets-example/
- For use later in my ghess browser/growser api
